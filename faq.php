        <h4>At what age can students begin martial arts training?</h4>
            
        <blockquote>Martial Arts is not just a sport, but a way of life. &nbsp; It is beneficial for people of all ages. &nbsp; At Legacy, we offer classes for students ages 3-103!  For children, it enhances focus, teaches discipline, and instills self-confidence. &nbsp; For adults, it is a great way to get exercise and reduce stress.</blockquote>
