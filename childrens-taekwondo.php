                <h3>Discipline</h3>
        
                <p>Taekwondo is not only healthy for the body, in that it motivates kids to get active, it also teaches discipline. &nbsp; Martial Arts revolves around respect, so your kids will listen to you the first time you tell them to do something.  You might even catch them saying: Yes Sir or Yes Ma'am!</p>

                <h3>Great Exercise</h3>
        
                <p>Martial Arts classes for kids are great exercise. &nbsp; Children who take Taekwondo are stronger, make healthier decisions about food, and learn to take care of themselves in general. &nbsp; You won't see any of our Black Belt students smoking or doing drugs, now or ever!</p>

                <h3>Self-Defense</h3>
        
                <p>Taekwondo teaches kids to avoid unsafe situations whenever possible. &nbsp; It is instilled upon children who learn martial arts to only use it in self-defense. &nbsp; However, should an occasion arise where it is necessary, your child will have learned to strike with effectiveness and power.</p>
